# Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Working Group (WG)

## What is this?

This is a repository contains files and content for the [DEI WG](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) within the [United States Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE)](https://us-rse.org/).

## How do I contribute?

Anyone can [open an issue](https://github.com/USRSE/dei-wg/issues/new/choose) on this repository to make suggestions, ask questions, etc.

## Join the WG!
First, you should [join US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/join/) and check out how to [Get Involved](https://us-rse.org/get-involved/), including joining our Slack Workspace.  Once you have joined the Slack, head over to the `#dei-discussion` channel and ping `@dei-wg` a request to be added to the DEI WG.  We have bi-weekly meetings that you can join, and active members of the WG are given access to our Shared Google Drive content as well as this repo.

## Our Projects
You can find more details about the DEI WG on the website, but here is a shortlist of our main projects:
* **DEI Speaker Series** - We host periodic speakers to give talks on DEI that are relevant to our community.  All are welcome!
* **DEI Media Club** - We host monthly discussions about media - such as podcasts or videos - that cover a range of DEI topics.  We tend to have a few meetings with one type of media, then switch to a new type for a while to ensure we cover a range of great content.  We are always open to suggestions for new topics!
* **Diversity in Leadership** - We are having ongoing discussions with US-RSE leadership about diversity in our election process.
* **DEI Resources/Toolkit** - We are compiling a set of DEI resources and tools that are relevant to the RSE community especially that we intend to share as toolkit for everyone from individuals to organizations that will help them engage with and improve DEI in our community.
* **Membership Survey** - We are working on creating an annual membership survey that can help us to keep track of important metrics, get community feedback, and find areas of concern to help inform us where our efforts are needed most.

If you want to start another project, please start by discussing it on the `#dei-discussion` channel of the US-RSE Slack
